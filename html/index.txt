1. What is the purpose of the alt attribute in an <img> tag?

The alt attribute in an <img> tag is used to provide alternative text for the image.
It is displayed when the image cannot be loaded or for accessibility purposes, allowing 
screen readers to describe the image to visually impaired users.


2. Explain the difference between <div> and <span> tags in HTML.

The <div> tag is a block-level element that is used to create divisions or sections in HTML, 
typically used for grouping and styling larger sections of content. The <span> tag, 
on the other hand, is an inline-level element used for grouping and applying styles to 
smaller portions of text or elements within a larger block-level element.

3. What are semantic elements in HTML? Provide some examples.

Semantic elements in HTML are tags that convey meaning and define the structure of the content.
They provide semantic information to both the browser and developers, making the code more 
meaningful and accessible. Some examples of semantic elements are 
<header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.

4. How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?

To create a hyperlink in HTML, you use the <a> tag, also known as the anchor tag. 
The href attribute is used to specify the destination URL that the link should point to. 
For example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a>.

5. Describe the difference between the <strong> and <em> tags in HTML.

The <strong> tag is used to indicate text with strong importance, typically rendered as bold by default. 
It carries semantic meaning. The <em> tag, on the other hand, is used to emphasize text, 
typically rendered as italic by default. It denotes emphasis rather than strong importance.

6. What is the difference between inline-block, block and inline displayes.

- block display:
    Takes up the entire width available by default and starts on a new line.
    The width, height, margin, and padding properties can be applied.
- inline display:
    Takes up only as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line.
    The width, height, margin-top, margin-bottom, and padding-top, padding-bottom properties do not apply.   
- inline-block display:
    Behaves like an inline element but also respects the width, height, margin, and padding properties.
    Takes up only as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line.    

7. What is the difference between <strong> and <b>

- <strong> tag:
    The <strong> tag is used to indicate strong importance or importance with higher significance to the content within it.
    It carries semantic meaning and should be used when the emphasis is important for the understanding or interpretation of the content.
    By default, the <strong> tag renders the text as bold, but the primary purpose is to convey importance rather than visual styling.
    Search engines and screen readers give more weight to text enclosed within <strong> tags.

- <b> tag:
    The <b> tag is used to apply a stylistic or presentational effect to text by making it bold.
    It does not carry any inherent semantic meaning and should be used only for visual styling purposes.
    The <b> tag is not recommended for use when semantic emphasis or importance is intended, as it does not provide the same level of semantic clarity as the <strong> tag.
    Search engines and screen readers may not interpret text within <b> tags as having any particular importance.
