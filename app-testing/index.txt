1. What is Testing Pyramid.

    Testing pyramid is one of the main concepts to guide application testing process.
    It consists of 3 main layers.

        1. Unit Testing: The bottom of the pyramid. Unit tests are focused on testing small parts of the application, for example 
           functions or small methods, components. Common packages are Jest and Mocha.
        2. Integration Testing: The middle of the pyramid. Integration tests ensure that different units or components of the application
           work together as expected, namely they test how different parts of application are communicating with each other. 
           Common packages are React Testing Library.
        3. End To End Testing: Top of the Pyramid. E2E are focused to test whole application as a real user interactions and workflows.
           Common packages are cypress.

2. What is Testing Cone and what is the difference between Testing Pyramid and Testing Cone.

    Testing Cone is one of the testing concepts to ensure high test coverage and full working functionality.
    It is similar to the Testing Pyramid, the difference is that Testing Cone emphases E2E testing, it places more importance on end to end testing.

3. What is CI/CD

    CI/CD stands as Continues Integration and Continues Delivery
    The benefits are to ensure high quality, faster development cycle, reduced risks.

    During Continues Integration multiple contributors of the project wrote and merge their codes into one common repository.
    During Continues Delivery code automatically deploys to various environments ensuring that we are always ready to deploy code.
