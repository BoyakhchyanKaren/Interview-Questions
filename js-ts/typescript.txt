1. What is the difference between interface and type


        1. Interfaces can be extended by another interface and can be implemented by the classes.
            Types can't be extended, they are using unions to create one combined type 

        2. Interfaces in the signle document can be created with the same name, in this case they will be merged in the usage
            Types are not supporting merging, they use intersactions.
        


2. What is the difference between any and unknown.

        1. No type safety for any, requires type checks for unknown.
        2. Any operation without checks allowed while using any, 	Operations only allowed after type check when using unknown.
