1. What is the difference between interface and eventType


        1. 
            Interfaces can be extended by another interface and can be implemented by the classes.
            Types can't be extended, they are using unions to create one combined type 

        2.

            Interfaces in the signle document can be created with the same name, in this case they will be merged in the usage
            Types are not supporting merging, they use intersactions.
